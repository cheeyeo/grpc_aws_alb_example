### GRPC on AWS Application Load Balancer

This is an example GRPC application that runs as an ECS service on a custom ECS cluster with traffic routed via the internet through an Application Load Balancer.

This is my attempt at re-creating the demo [from the following blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-support-for-end-to-end-http-2-and-grpc/)


The difference with the blog post is that I tried to implement end-to-end TLS as follows:

* ALB terminates TLS from ALB > Service

	We set the target group backend protocol as `HTTPS` and set the grpc service to run with `ssl_server_credentials` using same certificates stored in ACM

* gRPC client to service uses `secure_channel` to invoke the service using the same certificates



Like the post, I adopted the route guide grpc example [from the official grpc repo](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/examples/python/route_guide) and adapted it as follows:

* Added an option to the route_guide_client.py file to allow for secure channel communication. Default is False

* Added an option to the route_guide_server.py to allow for server-side TLS with the client. Default is False.

When running locally, use the Makefile to generate the libs from the protobuf and to generate the certs and build the docker container:

```
# create a .env file with an aws profile name and ecr repo link

source .env

make build-protobufs

make cert

make build-docker
```

To run locally:
```
# to use TLS auth
python route_guide_client.py --secure


python route_guide_server.py --secure
```

### Deploying to AWS

The terraform scripts provision the following resources:

* ECS Cluster
* Application Load Balancer
* Fargate ECS Service
* Custom VPC with 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets ( ALB need at least 2 subnets )

To provision:
```
make setup
```

Get the `load_balancer` output and export it as `HOST` env var which will be read by the client.

If all goes well with running against AWS, one should see the following output:
```
export HOST=<DNS A record of ALB from terraform output>

python route_guide_client.py --secure


REMOTE HOST >  route-guide-1954688975.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

### gRPC TLS Notes

* ALB uses TLS cert to terminate front-end connection, and decrypts requests from clients before sending it to targets

	ALB operates at Application Layer


* TLS terminates at ALB and connection between ALB and backend left unencrypted


* To use a self signed cert on ALB, we need to sign the cert with `subjectAltName` set to both `localhost` and `*.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`. This can be adjusted to suit...

	Note that this is by no means a secure way of running a production service. The private keys should be encrypted using secrets manager and loaded into the service at runtime...

* Also the certificate should be issued to a domain, and we can create an Route 53 Alias record that points to the DNS A record of the ALB ...

* If running with server-side TLS on, we need to enable HTTPS for healthcheck else ALB fails...


* To inspect the generated TLS certs we can use openssl:
```
openssl x509 -in server.crt --text
```
